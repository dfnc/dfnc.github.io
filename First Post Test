I am testing if this is markdown language.

To do so, I am going to try and post multiple formats of text and see what the results are.

#Testing this as a comment

# Testing this as a comment

' Testing this as a comment

" Testing this as a comment

/Testing this as a comment

: Testing this as a comment.

Not to self: since my first few posts will be about custom programs made for my TI-84 Plus, I should see if I can make custom markdown styles.

I'm not seeing any formatting here, so maybe this is just plain text.
